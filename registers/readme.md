# Ancillary Registers

This directory contains XML register files that are compatible with SMPTE 2001-1 "XML Representation of SMPTE Registered Data (Reg-XML) — Mapping Rules" and SMPTE 2001-2 "XML Representation of SMPTE Registered Data (Reg-XML) — AAF and MXF Data". These files contain register entries that are not appropriate for distribution via the standard [registers](https://registry.smpte-ra.org/) published by SMPTE because they are defined in private namespaces or are in some other way incompatible with the SMPTE Engineering Document process. Nonetheless these values are in use in the industry, including their use in asdcplib, and so they are distributed here with permission from the original publisher.
